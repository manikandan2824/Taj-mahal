                     <h1>Is there a sight more iconic, more beautiful, more jaw-droppingly spectacular than the Taj Mahal?</h1><br><br>
                     <p class="p-1">
                        Quite honestly, we can’t think of one. <br><br>

At the very least, there’s no mausoleum more grand, no declaration of love more apparent than building a marble masterpiece <br> for
 one’s favorite wife… And no better reason to travel than seeing its magnificence up close. <br><br> 

After all, this is art. Built in Agra,<b><a href="" style="color: brown;">india</a></b> between 1631 and 1648, it’s also history. And, ofcourse,
 it’s the perfect opportunity to <br>take some otherworldly photos.So, 
 to help visitors prepare for their Taj Mahal travels, we’ve prepared 
 a little guide, enlisting <br> the help of some Intrepid experts from Destination Managers to acclaimed trip leaders – to cover all the 
 bases. <br><br>

Coming up: what to bring, where to take the best snaps, what else to see in Agra (and beyond), and so much more…<br><br>
                <strong style="font-size: 20px;">Before you arrive at the Taj Mahal</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                That old saying ‘patience is a virtue’ really comes into its own when discussing the Taj Mahal.

                Be prepared to be surrounded <br> by hundreds (if not thousands) of people. These include Indian men,
                 women and children who may ask to take photos with <br> you.
                
                To prepare with the help of other travelers and a local tour guide, consider taking a group tour.
                 Intrepid have Taj-visiting <br> trips that  range from <b style="font-size: 18px; color: brown;">8-day Golden 
                    Triangle tours</b> (now <b style="color: brown;">with solo-only
                        departures!</b> ) to 15-day trips dedicated to food, <br> to 19-day trips combining the <strong style="color: brown;">highlights of India and Nepal</strong>.
                
                If you’re more pressed for time, you can check out the Taj Mahal <br> on  a whirlwind day  tour from Delhi.
                 Check out <b style="font-size: 20px;">Urban Adventures</b> to see the itinerary that we’d recommend for this. And <br> while you’re at it,
                  check  out their day trips in <b style="color: brown;">Delhi, Jaipur</b>, <b style="font-size: 20px;">Varanasi and Mumbai!</b>
                     </p><br>

                     <p class="p-2">
                        The entrance queue can be pretty long during peak season but as long as you’re mentally prepared,
                         you’ll be fine. What’s to  <br>come is more than worth the wait…<br><br>

                        <strong style="font-size: 20px;">What to bring to the Taj Mahal</strong> <br><br>
                        Always leave your valuables in the hotel. There are lockers available
                         at the Taj but it’s best to have minimal belongings on <br> you so you don’t spend too much time
                          checking in. <br>
                        
                        You really only need to bring the following in one small bag:
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Passport</li><br>
                        <li>money</li><br>
                        <li>water</li><br>
                        <li>Medicine</li><br>
                        <li>phone</li><br>
                        <li> camera</li><br>
                     </ul>
                    </p><br><br>
                    <p class="p-3">
                        <b style="font-size: 20px;">What to wear to the Taj Mahal</b>
                         <br>
                     There is no dress code but you should still be respectful. If you want to enter the mosque, you will need to
                      cover your  <br>head,shoulders and knees. <br>
                     
                     It gets hot in Agra and there is very little shade, so wear light clothing and make sure you wear sunscreen. 
                      Then again, <br> Agra also gets very cold in winter (Nov-Feb) so layers are your friend too. <br>
                     
                     If you visit with Intrepid, you’ll be taken there earlier in the day or later in the afternoon to avoid the
                      worst of the heat. <br>

                    <p>Useful tip from Ryan Turner, Intrepid’s Destination Manager for India:</p><br>
                     <img src="img-1.jpg" alt="pic-1" width="850"><br>
                     <p class="p-3">
                        <b style="font-size: 20px;">Other things you need to know</b> <br>
                        No food is allowed inside. <br>
                        
                        Cigarettes and lighters are also not allowed. <br>
                        
                        Tripods and additional lighting equipment need prior permission to be brought with. Photography inside 
                        the mausoleum <br> is prohibited. Most electronics (except cameras and small video cameras) are not allowed. <br>
                        
                        Be wary of touts, thieves and rude shop keepers. It’s a busy, high-pressure area, but keep your wits
                         about you and you <br> won’t need to worry! <br>
                        
                        <b style="font-size: 20px;">When you’re at the Taj Mahal</b> <br>
                        Go early, wait for space to explore and photograph, and get yourself away from the crowds (if possible).</p>

                <div class="b-4">

                     alt="pic-1" width="870"> 
                    <p class="p-4"> If you walk around to the right side of the Taj (as you approach the east gate), you can get an amazing photo
                         from the river <br>bank behind the Taj. (Always go in groups and get a rickshaw to take you there and back cheaply.)
                         <br> <br>
                        And simply focus on taking in all the magic. Even Intrepid leaders who see the Taj Mahal monthly (or more!)
                         remain in awe <br> of it. <b style="color: brown;">Sana Jinah</b>, one of the company’s inspiring female tour guides, has some tips on how to 
                         do this:</p>

                            She also recommends those looking for optimum conditions try visiting the Taj Mahal at sunrise on a
                             clear day. <br><br>

                            <b style="font-size: 20px;">Tips for taking photos at the Taj Mahal</b>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Everyone wants that iconic shot of themselves at the Taj Mahal. You know the one – where you sit
                             on the bench and the <br> grandeur of the marble mausoleum forms the backdrop.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="b-5">
                    <img src="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/india_agra_taj-mahal_taking-in-the-surroundings.jpg" 
                    alt="pic-1" width="850">
                    <p class="p-5">
                        But if you’re feeling creative and want to mix things up, there are tons of different angles worth seeking out. <br>

                        Below are some photography suggestions from Intrepid’s General Manager in India, 
                        <b style="color: brown; font-size: 20px;">Pravin Tamang</b>.
                         (His photography is <br> amazing – <b style="color: brown; font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;">check it out!</b> ) <br> <br>
                    <ul>
                       <li> Shot from the arch of the main doorway</li><br>
                        <li> Capture the reflection of the fountains that line the route towards the Taj Mahal’s main platform</li> <br>
                       <li> Shot of Taj Mahal from the riverside with the reflection on the river</li><br>
                        <li>Shot from the other side of the river, ‘Mehtab Bagh’, where you get a glimpse of Taj</li><br>
                        <li>The Taj Mahal can also be shot from some parts of the Red Fort</li> 
                    </ul></p> <br>

                       <p class="p-5"> You can also get great photos from the many rooftops of restaurants close to the Taj Mahal. 
                        Unfortunately, Agra does get <br> pretty smoggy, so winter can often have poor visibility earlier in the day
                         and around sunset. That said, this can make shots <br> look very atmospheric!
                    </p>

                        <strong style="font-size: 25px;">What to do after visiting the Taj Mahal</strong> <br>
                   First, go back to your hotel room, take a shower, and revel in the relative peace and quiet. Then explore these 
                   cool <br> destinations both in and out of Agra: <br>

                   <b style="font-size: 18px;">What to do in Agra</b> <br>
                   The Taj Mahal is, quite clearly, the star of the show in this northern Indian city. But the Agra Fort is also 
                    stunning, especially <br> if you didn’t get a chance to go to the Red Fort in Delhi. A 16th-century Mughal monument
                     and UNESCO World Heritage <br>site, it’s a sight not to be missed. <br><br>

                     Despite being located on the <b style="color: brown; font-size: 18px; text-decoration: underline;">Golden Triangle</b> tourist circuit, there’s less to do in Agra than in many other
                      Indian cities. <br>It’s  pretty polluted from the heavy industry (more on that later) and you likely won’t spend
                       too long there, whatever the trip. <br><br>

                    One way that Intrepid tries to show visitors a different perspective on the country is by (sometimes) taking
                     travelers to <br> <b style="color: brown; font-size: 18px; text-decoration: underline;">sheroes  Hangout</b>. Just blocks from the Taj Mahal, it’s a small cafe run entirely by female acid 
                     attack  survivors. Here,<br> victims of attacks are employed and tell their stories. It can be confronting, but also
                      inspiring and memorable in equal <br> measures. <br><br>

                     There are various great destinations only a few hours drive (well, 4-7) from the Taj Mahal. Of these, Orchha, Jaipur
                      and <br>Pushkar are all tourist-friendly, peaceful and beautiful place <br>

                    Orchha is a town that travelers often overlook. This is a shame, because it’s historic, laid-back and has a
                     bunch of beautiful <br> temples. It’s not always on tour itineraries, but you CAN visit it on this

                        Jaipur is much more well-known. Also known as the <b style="color: rgb(187, 39, 39); font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;">pink city

                        </b>
                        , the capital of Rajasthan is full of chaos,
                         charm and unique <br> architecture. Visit the hilltop Amber Fort, haggle in the enchanting bazaars, and consider 
                         taking a hot air balloon over the city <br> to take it all in. <br>

                        Pushkar is another underrated town. One of the oldest and most serene towns in India, it’s home to Pushkar
                         Lake, a sacred spot <br> for Hindus that’s utterly dazzling at sundown. Because of its holy nature, the vegetarian 
                         food here is simply unmissable. Visit on <br> <b style="color: rgb(194, 38, 38); font-size: 20px; text-decoration: underline;">this 15-day trip</b> all around Rajasthan. <br>
                        
                        <b style="font-size: 25px;">A final note about the Taj Mahal’s mud therapy </b><br><br>
                        As you may have read or heard, the Taj Mahal has recently been undergoing a very thorough clean. Yep, to be 
                        precise, a mud <br> mask as of April 2018. <br>
                        
                        Why? Air pollution from factories in Agra had been slowly turning the Taj Mahal’s ivory-white surfaces
                         yellow – and this was <br> one way of restoring them to their former glory. The work – applying a clay traditionally
                          used to clean marble to the entire <br> structure of the Taj – was carried out by the Archaeological Survey of 
                          India. And this work was part of a series of restorative <br>projects carried out on the historic site.
